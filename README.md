# Fake-profile-detection-in-facebook-communtites-using-sna
This project detects structurally weak or fake accounts in Facebook-like social networks using clustering coefficient—a graph-based metric from Social Network Analysis (SNA). The tool is implemented using Python, Flask, NetworkX, and Matplotlib. Users can upload a CSV edge list representing the social graph, and the system flags potentially fake users based on their low structural embeddedness.
